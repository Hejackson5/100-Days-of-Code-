#introduction to the bill tip calculator

print("Welcome to the tip calculator")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? "))
tip = float(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, of 15? "))
people =float(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

#how things are calculated
#the round helps with the decimil , the 2 in the parentheses indicates how many decimils it moves up

total_tip = (bill * tip / 100)
total_bill = bill + total_tip
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

#print total
#f" allows us to mix strings and variables

print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
