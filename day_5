#with our password_list variable being empty we will use the += with the random.choice function(letters)
#its pretty awesome the workings behind it, if we select 6 from our letter count input. The loop will go through
#using the random.choice(letters) it will pick 6 random choices from the letters list
#the same will be done for the numbers list

#password_list shuffle. the random.shuffle function will do that for us. The next step is adding another variable
#with the password variable we will leave it empty. Now with this last for loop we will pull from the password_list list
#now we will use the password variable with += to add all of the characters in a printable format
